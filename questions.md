1. What happens with OET on successful StableCoinStrikeAuction bidding?
2. Are new OET issued on successful StableCoinStrikeAuction bidding?
3. What happens with the spread on maturity?
4. What are those 98 cents related to? Is it just some small arbitrary value? Should it be percentage of notional? Should it be percentage of premium?
5. Is it ok to consider that StableCoinStrikeAuction is 1-1 to OptionPricingMarket?
6. Do we allow users to pick any maturity in OptionPricingMarket or pick one from the list of provided options or do we have just 1 option. (Maturity is reset on each auction restart so if we dont allow to pick arbitrary value we might have issues with pairing)
7 Is call spread an option type (same as short put, long call etc)?
